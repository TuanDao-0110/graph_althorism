## include DFS vs BFS althorism
# Althorism include how to solve graph's problem: 

1. Clearify the concept using Stack (FIFO) by using DFS
2. Clearify the concept using Queue (FILO) by using BFS
3. Clearify the concept Undirected path vs Directed path.
4. Apply to search a path between nodes
5. Apply to find shortest path betwen nodes
6. Apply to find largest paths connection in graphs
7. Apply to find path connection in Matrix island
    1. Counting Island, 
    2. Find Biggest/Smallest connected paths in Matrix island.
